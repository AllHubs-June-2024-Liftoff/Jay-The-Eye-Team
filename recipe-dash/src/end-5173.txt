In PowerShell, use the netstat command to find the process using the port:
                netstat -ano | findstr :5173

This will give you the PID (Process ID) of the process occupying port 5173. The output will look something like this:
        TCP    [::]:5173              [::]:0                 LISTENING       12345
Here, 12345 is the PID.

2. Kill the process using Taskkill:
Once you have the PID, you can stop the process with the following command:
        taskkill /PID 12345 /F
Make sure to replace 12345 with the actual PID from the previous step.

3. Verify the port is free:
After killing the process, you can verify that the port is free by running the netstat command again:
        netstat -ano | findstr :5173
If there's no output, that means the port is now free.
